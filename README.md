# WinTop: Python System Monitoring Tool

`WinTop` is a lightweight Python-based system monitoring tool for Windows, inspired by **htop**. It provides real-time information about CPU usage, memory consumption, and processes, with colored output for better visibility.

## Features
- **Real-time CPU usage** for each core.
- **Memory usage statistics**.
- **Top 10 processes** sorted by CPU usage.
- **Colored output** to highlight important system stats (e.g., high CPU processes in red).

## Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher
- The following Python libraries:
  - `psutil`
  - `windows-curses`

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/z0uz/wintop.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil windows-curses
   ```

## Usage

Run the Python script:
```bash
python wintop.py
```

### Key Features
- **CPU Usage**: Displays per-core CPU usage in real-time.
- **Memory Usage**: Shows the total memory used and available.
- **Process List**: Displays the top 10 processes by CPU usage, with those consuming more than 50% CPU in **red**.

## Known Issues
- If your terminal is too small, some output may not display properly. Try resizing the terminal window to fit all the content.
- This tool is designed for **Windows**. For Linux, `htop` is recommended, or you can adapt the code with `ncurses` instead of `windows-curses`.
